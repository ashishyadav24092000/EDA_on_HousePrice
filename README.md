# EDA_on_HousePrice
In this repository I have performed Exploratory data analysis on the dataset famously known as House Price Prediction.  
## Folowing things have been considered while analysis ::
1. Missing Values
2. All The Numerical Variables
3. Distribution of the Numerical Variables
4. Categorical Variables
5. Cardinality of Categorical Variables --> total no. of category of any feature
6. Outliers
7. Relationship between independent and dependent feature(SalePrice)
